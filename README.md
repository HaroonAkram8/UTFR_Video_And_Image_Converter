# UTFR_Video_And_Image_Converter

This is an old video converter I made for UTFR. The purpose of it is to take an input video and break it up into its individual frames. Then, run YOLOv7 on the images of each frame and detect the cones. Finally, convert the resulting output images from YOLOv7 with the labelled cones back into a video.
